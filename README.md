# ArduinoImageConverter
Made as an auxillary tool for my CS120B Final Project. 

Will generate c++ code specific to Arudino AVR for image data.

I wanted to convert a bunch of png images to a monochrome, 1bpp data array.
Other tools online was not able to serve my needs, so I resorted to making my own.
The format is just a bit stream, left to right.

Only the monochrome is tested, haven't tested the other formats.
